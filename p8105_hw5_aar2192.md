Problem 1
=========

-   Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help

``` r
longitudinal_df =
    tibble(file_name = list.files(path = "./data")) 
```

-   Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

``` r
  longitudinal_df =
    tibble(participant = list.files(path = "./data"),
           csv_file = str_c(path = "./data/", participant)) %>% 
    mutate(data = map(csv_file, read_csv)) %>% 
    unnest
